**This is a streamlined password generator that provides users various criteria or options to choose from and generates a password accordingly.**

**User clicks generate, they are then prompted with options for the length of the password (between 8 - 128 characters), lower-case, upper-case, numbers and special characters.**

**The user must choose atleast one criteria and remain within the specified length or the process will not continue.**

**A randomly generated password will then be displayed in the primary box.**
